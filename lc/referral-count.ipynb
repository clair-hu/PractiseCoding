    "Okay, got it. To count the number of children nodes for all the nodes in a directed graph on LeetCode, you can use a similar approach to the one I mentioned earlier, but with a few modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the step-by-step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Represent the graph**: As before, use an adjacency list representation to store the graph, where the keys are the nodes, and the values are lists of their child nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Implement the DFS function**: Define a DFS function that takes a node as input and returns the count of children nodes for that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def dfs(node, graph, child_counts):\n",
    "       if node not in child_counts:\n",
    "           child_counts[node] = 0\n",
    "           for child in graph[node]:\n",
    "               child_counts[node] += 1 + dfs(child, graph, child_counts)\n",
    "       return child_counts[node]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Traverse the graph and count the children nodes**: Iterate through all the nodes in the graph and call the `dfs` function for each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def countSubTree(edges):\n",
    "       graph = defaultdict(list)\n",
    "       for u, v in edges:\n",
    "           graph[u].append(v)\n",
    "\n",
    "       child_counts = {}\n",
    "       for node in graph:\n",
    "           dfs(node, graph, child_counts)\n",
    "\n",
    "       return child_counts\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handle disconnected graphs**: If the graph is disconnected, you'll need to make sure to visit all the nodes. You can do this by iterating through all the nodes in the graph and calling the `dfs` function for each unvisited node.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def countSubTree(edges):\n",
    "       graph = defaultdict(list)\n",
    "       for u, v in edges:\n",
    "           graph[u].append(v)\n",
    "\n",
    "       child_counts = {}\n",
    "       for node in graph:\n",
    "           if node not in child_counts:\n",
    "               dfs(node, graph, child_counts)\n",
    "\n",
    "       return child_counts\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the complete Python code that implements this solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from collections import defaultdict\n",
    "\n",
    "def dfs(node, graph, child_counts):\n",
    "    if node not in child_counts:\n",
    "        child_counts[node] = 0\n",
    "        for child in graph[node]:\n",
    "            child_counts[node] += 1 + dfs(child, graph, child_counts)\n",
    "    return child_counts[node]\n",
    "\n",
    "def countSubTree(edges):\n",
    "    graph = defaultdict(list)\n",
    "    for u, v in edges:\n",
    "        graph[u].append(v)\n",
    "\n",
    "    child_counts = {}\n",
    "    for node in graph:\n",
    "        if node not in child_counts:\n",
    "            dfs(node, graph, child_counts)\n",
    "\n",
    "    return child_counts\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution first builds the adjacency list representation of the graph, then performs a DFS traversal for each unvisited node, updating the `child_counts` dictionary as it goes. Finally, it returns the `child_counts` dictionary, which contains the count of children nodes for each node in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
