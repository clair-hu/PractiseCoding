    "On our journey to democratize finance for all, we’ve created the concept of fractional shares. Fractional shares are pieces, or fractions, of whole shares of a company or ETF.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, exchanges only trade in whole shares. Robinhood is required to manage the fractional portion of each trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Robinhood has 0 shares of AAPL and then a customer wishes to purchase 1.5 AAPL shares, Robinhood will need to request 2 shares from the exchange and hold on to the remaining 0.5 shares.\n",
    "If another customer requests to purchase 0.4 shares of AAPL, Robinhood can use its inventory (0.5 shares) instead of going out to the exchange and will have 0.1 shares of AAPL remaining.\n",
    "If the third customer requests 0.5 shares, Robinhood can fill 0.1 shares out of inventory but will need to go to the exchange for an additional share leaving Robinhood's inventory at 0.6 shares.\n",
    "If a customer requests a dollar based order, we need to convert it to the relevant number of shares and run through the above steps.\n",
    "Always ensure the firm has a positive quantity in inventory and has under one share after handling an order. There's no need for us to hold onto whole shares!\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Handle buying fractional shares.\n",
    "Handle selling fractional shares.\n",
    "Ensure inventory is less than 1 after each order.\n",
    "e.g. Customer sells AAPL for 0.75 and then another sells AAPL for 0.50 -- we have 1.25 inventory. We can sell 1 share to the market and keep our inventory small at 0.25.\n",
    "Ensure inventory is always non-negative after each order.\n",
    "e.g. Inventory is 0.2 and the customer buys 0.5 shares: ensure we end up with 0.7 shares in inventory.\n",
    "Always “flatten”! (steps 3+4)\n",
    "The final 2 digits of every integer is the decimal. e.g. 1000 = 10.00, 20 = 0.20, 100 = 1.\n",
